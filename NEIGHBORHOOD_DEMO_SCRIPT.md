### **🔧 Technical Approach**

**Simple & Effective:**
```javascript
// Neighborhood definitions with local aliases
const HOODS = {
  marina: ["marina", "cow hollow", "union street", "chestnut"],
  mission: ["mission", "valencia", "24th street", "dolores"]
};

// Smart matching function
function textMatchesHood(text, neighborhood, loose=false) {
  const aliases = loose ? NEARBY[neighborhood] : [neighborhood];
  return aliases.some(hood => 
    HOODS[hood].some(alias => text.toLowerCase().includes(alias))
  );
}
```

**Benefits:**
- ⚡ **Fast**: No API calls or coordinate calculations

### **🎬 Sample Demo Narrative**

**"Let me show you how FixNow understands San Francisco neighborhoods."**

**[Show homeowner view with contractor list]**

**"Right now we're showing contractors from all of SF. But what if I only want someone local to the Mission District?"**

**[Click location dropdown, select Mission]**

**"Watch this - in Strict mode, we only show contractors who specifically mention Mission District in their posts. See how the list filtered from 20 down to 8 contractors?"**

**[Toggle to Loose mode]**

**"But if that's too restrictive, I can switch to Loose mode. Now we include nearby neighborhoods like Castro and SOMA. Back up to 15 contractors."**

**[Use voice agent]**

**"And here's the cool part - when I ask our AI for a plumber, it knows I'm focused on Mission District and gives me location-aware recommendations."**

**[Show technical approach]**

**"This works through smart keyword matching - no complex geocoding needed. We know that Mission includes Valencia Street, 24th Street, Dolores. Marina includes Cow Hollow, Union Street. Fast, accurate, and it understands the city like a local."**

**Result: Judges see intelligent location filtering that enhances the entire experience!** 🚀
