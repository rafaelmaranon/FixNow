### **🔧 If Something Doesn't Work**

**No Publish Button?**
- Make sure you said "leak" or "electrical" to trigger problem recognition
- The button appears after the agent recognizes a repair issue

**No Agent Events?**
- Check that backend is running on port 3001
- Check browser console for API errors
- Verify AgentTicker is polling /api/events

**No Offers Appear?**
- Wait 3-4 seconds after clicking Publish
- Check that offers endpoint returns data: `curl http://localhost:3001/api/jobs/21/offers`
