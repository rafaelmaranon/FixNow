    - title: "Multi-Agent Event Integrity"
      guidelines: |
        Each event must include: type, actor, jobId, audience (homeowner|contractor|both),
        and contractorId when relevant. Use a single emitter (addEvent) and avoid branches
        that skip emission.
    - title: "API Contract Consistency"
      guidelines: |
        Validate shared types (Job, Offer, Booking) are updated together across
        backend and frontend. Flag mismatched field names and unchecked any casts.
    - title: "Async Safety"
      guidelines: |
        Look for race conditions in Publish -> RFO -> Offer -> Select -> Award flow.
        Flag non-atomic updates and missing idempotency on offer selection.
