> **A revolutionary repair marketplace powered by 3 specialized AI agents working in perfect collaboration.**

**Perfect alignment with hackathon theme: "Multi-Agent Collaboration"** 🎯

## 🤖 **Multi-Agent Collaboration System**

### **The 3 Specialized Agents**

**🏠 Homeowner Agent**
- Voice + photo analysis for problem understanding
- Price education and repair guidance  
- Job publishing decisions and contractor evaluation
- Booking confirmation and management

**📋 Dispatcher Agent**  
- Job coordination and RFO (Request for Offers) broadcasting
- Contractor matching and filtering by capabilities
- Offer collection, evaluation, and presentation
- Award management and booking creation

**👷 Contractor Agent**
- Job filtering by category, location, and budget
- Competitive bid generation with multiple personas
- Fast vs budget contractor optimization
- Real-time response coordination

### **🎯 Perfect Theme Alignment**

This system demonstrates **true multi-agent collaboration** - not just multiple chatbots, but specialized agents that:
- ✅ **Delegate tasks** between each other
- ✅ **Coordinate responses** in real-time  
- ✅ **Work together** to solve complete problems
- ✅ **Show visible workflow** that judges can observe

## 🏗️ **Production-Quality Architecture**
