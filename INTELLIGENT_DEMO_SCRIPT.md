### **🏠 Part 1: Intelligent Problem Analysis (90 seconds)**

**1. Start the Conversation**
- **Show**: Homeowner view with voice agent
- **Click**: 🎤 microphone button
- **Say**: "My kitchen sink is leaking badly"
- **Watch**: Agent creates draft job and responds intelligently

**Agent Response:**
> "I see you have a plumbing issue. Let me analyze this for you.
> 
> For water leaks, typical costs in SF range from $150-$400. Can you upload a photo so I can give you a more specific diagnosis and price estimate?"

**2. Upload Photo for Analysis**
- **Click**: "📷 Add Photo" button
- **Upload**: Any image (system will simulate analysis)
- **Watch**: "Analyzing your photo..." → Detailed analysis appears

**Agent Analysis:**
> "Great! I can see this is likely a P-trap leak (78% confidence).
> 
> **What I see:** loose compression nut, cracked P-trap, worn gasket
> 
> **Common fixes:**
> • Tighten compression nut with teflon tape: $120-$180 (~20min)
> • Replace P-trap (PVC): $200-$320 (~40min)
> 
> **Typical SF: $180–$350**
> 
> If ignored: cabinet damage, mold growth, higher repair costs"

**3. Interactive Follow-Up**
- **Show**: Quick answer chips appear
- **Click**: "Is the drip constant or only when the sink runs?"
- **Click**: "Only when running" chip
- **Agent**: "Got it! Based on that detail, I'm more confident this is a P-trap leak. Tighten compression nut would likely cost $120-$180. Ready to find contractors?"
